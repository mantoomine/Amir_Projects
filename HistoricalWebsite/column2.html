          Sam has a very beautiful child from his beautiful wife, but all his
          hair, eyelashes and body were white as snow. Sam took his child to
          Alborz Mountain for fear of being rebuked by the people. He put it
          where Simorgh had a nest, maybe Simorgh would eat the child. But by
          the command of God, Simorgh protected and raised that child. Years
          passed, the child grew up with many addresses from the father. Sam
          dreamed that a man on a greyhound came to him from the land of India
          and announced that your child was alive. After praying, Sam went to
          Alborz Mountain with a group. Simorgh saw Sam and his group from the
          top of the mountain and knew that they were looking for the child.
          Simorgh returned to the young man and told him the story of his
          childhood, saying that now Sam Pulvan, the proudest man in the world,
          was looking for you. The young man was sad when he heard Simorgh's
          words. Tears welled up in his eyes and he answered in the language of
          Simorgh, because he had not spoken to a human being. Simorgh said: I
          did not hear your name today. Know that I will never leave you alone
          and bring you to the kingdom. I have closed my heart to you so that I
          can always be with you. Simorgh tamed the heart of his hands and took
          him on his back and sat down on the ground near Sam. They brought the
          robes of a bowman and dressed him young and came down from the
          mountain and all of them went to Iranshahr together and went to see
          Manouchehr. Manouchehr Farmani wrote that the whole of Kabul and the
          land of India until the Indus Sea from Zabulistan to the banks of the
          river should be the place of Pulvan Sam. In Zabulistan, Sam left the
          throne and the key to the treasure, and after the advice of his son,
          he himself went to Gargsaran and Mazandaran to fight the court and the
          enemies by the order of Manouchehr, the Shah of Iran. A day passed
          until one day the young Zal Aung traveled and hunted. Murab Shah of
          Kabul, a wise and brave man, was of Zahak race and ransomer of Sam
          Shah of Zabulistan and had a very beautiful daughter named Rudabeh.
          Zal and Rudabeh fell in love without seeing each other, but Rudabeh
          race was difficult to connect. After a period of correspondence
          between Zal and Sam, and even Sam preparing for war with Murab, Zal
          finally visits Manouchehr, and after his testing by the priests,
          Manouchehr agrees to this connection. Sam, who sees the child in his
          heart, entrusts the kingdom, throne and crown of Zabulistan to
          Zal.Siavash was born from the marriage of a woman from Salari Garsiuz
          to Kikavous. Since the court was not a suitable place for Siavash to
          grow up; Kikavous handed Siavash over to Rustam to raise and teach
          him. In Zabulistan, Rostam taught Siavash the rite of command and
          governance and taught him some of his most worthy qualities, such as
          horseback riding, archery, bow-throwing, hunting, as well as moral
          arts. After Siavash returned to his father's palace from Zabulistan,
          Kavous played him and held a celebration to celebrate his son's
          arrival. The handsome Siavash is such that everyone is amazed by his
          beauty like Yusuf. On the other hand, good morals, including chastity
          and shame, are also prominent features of him. Soodabeh, the daughter
          of Shah Hamavaran and the wife of Kikavus, fell in love with Siavash
          after seeing him. As in secret, he sent a courier to Siavash and
          invited him to the royal nave, but Siavash refused. The next day,
          Soodabeh went to Kikavus and asked him to send Siavash to the nursery
          so that he could choose a wife from among his daughters. Siavash also
          had to go to the nursery to obey his father's order. After the girls
          left, Soodabeh praised Siavash's beauty and offered her a relationship
          with Siavash, but Siavash refused. For the third time, Soodabeh called
          Siavash to him and offered himself to him, but Siavash was upset and
          left bitterly. By turning the story upside down, Soodabeh informed
          Kavous and accused Siavash.
