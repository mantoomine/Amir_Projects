          He has a strange birthday. His mother is a Turanian girl who
          accidentally (and perhaps miraculously) enters the court of Kavus. He
          is the ultimate youth of beauty, bravery, piety, kindness and
          forgiveness. Siavash does not give in to sin, the fire testifies to
          his purity, and he is killed oppressed by the jealousy and malice of
          evil people. This Iranian myth has an undeniable resemblance to the
          three characters of the Abrahamic religions. Like Joseph, he escapes
          from the trap of sin that a cunning woman throws at him, because
          Abraham, by the grace of God, does not set him on fire, and because
          John is killed oppressed and his murderers pay a heavy price for this
          crime.

          One day, Tus, along with Goodarz, Gio and Chandsavar, go hunting in
          Nakhjirgah and see a beautiful girl there. The girl says that she is a
          relative of Gersius (brother of Afrasiab, king of Turan) and fled to
          Iran because her father was angry and wanted to kill her. Tus and Gio
          both like their daughter and they intend to marry her and they get
          involved in this issue. They take the case to Kikavous, the king of
          Iran, but Kikavous falls in love with his daughter and marries her.
          The result of this connection is a handsome boy who, when he is born,
          is filled with joy and gives him the name of Siavakhsh. But
          astrologers see his astrology very disturbing and warn Kavous. The
          Shah entrusts Siavash to Rustam for upbringing and education. Rustam
          takes him to Zabulistan for upbringing. . .

          During the reign of Manouchehr, Sam Nariman, the commander and hero of
          Iran, ruled Zabulistan. She has a white-haired son. Sam, who considers
          this congenital defect of his child a disgrace to himself; He orders
          the child to be left in the Alborz mountains to be preyed upon by
          birds and predators. But a bird named Simorgh hears the baby crying
          and has mercy on him and raises him with his children. After years,
          Sam finds his son dreaming that he has become beautiful, strong and
          brave. In a dream, someone attacks him: â€œMan! Why did you thank God
          and leave the child of innocence helpless in the mountains? You saw
          his white hair, but you did not see his pure body and soul. "How can
          you be a father who now has to take care of your child?" Sam wakes up
          and regrets what he did. He goes to the Alborz mountains with his
          troops. But Simorgh's nest is so high that it is inaccessible.
          Eventually, Simorgh sees the soldiers and realizes that they have come
          after the young white man (who called him Dastan). Simorgh says to
          him: "O hero! ......
